Python Package to Support Cambridge Audio Network Audio Players (Stream Magic)

This is a simple package to provide basic support for Cambridge Audio's Network Audio Players.
It currently has only been tested with the Azur 851N model, but should be compatible with other models too.
As all functions are based on the UPnP-AV (DLNA) standard, there's a good possibility that other DLNA audio players will work as well.
Though they might differ in some details, breaking stuff.
